# Software Development and Machine Learning Projects

A repository of complete end-to-end machine learning projects I have done. Each folder is designed to have friendly code, if you are interested in the specifics of my workflow. The modules in each project are arranged sequentially, so just start from "Module 1." 

Machine Learning:

AppraiserServiceRegressionProject: The goal of this project was to build a model that predicted a fair transaction price of a property before it's sold. This ultimately became a regression problem. The real estate dataset I used is in this project.

EmployeeRetentionClassificationProject: The goal of this was to build a model that predicted whether a full time employee at a software company will quit the company any time soon. This became a binary classification problem. The company dataset I used is in this project.

Developing this system was a huge learning experience because I implemented a systematic way of approaching most machine learning problems. I organize the project into modules consisting of data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training/building. After completing these projects, I developed a real-world understanding of solving machine learning problems. This includes the importance of developing good data and coding a framework for preventing overfit models (model pipelines that get cross validated).

Implementation details are in the folders. 

Software Dev:

Ableton: The goal was to create a simplified version of this feature https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/launching-clips/#13-6-follow-actions
of the digital audio workstation Ableton Live. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableton_Live This was a hefty C++ OOP project. This project required parsing an input text file and tokenizing each word, making meaning out of different keywords via storing them creatively in containers/classes, and performing different tasks based on different input text errors. More details about the problem statement ares in the folder. From this project, I learned how to deliver client needs with an ambiguous problem statement. I also learned how to code with just the C++ standard library: using containers, iterators, etc.
