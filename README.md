# MachineLearningProjects

A repository of complete end-to-end machine learning projects I have done. Each folder is designed to have friendly code, if you are interested in the specifics of my workflow. The modules in each project are arranged sequentially, so just start from "Module 1." 

Developing this system was a huge learning experience because I implemented a systematic way of approaching most machine learning problems. I organize the project into modules consisting of data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training/building. After completing these projects, I developed a real-world understanding of solving machine learning problems. This includes the importance of developing good data and coding a framework for preventing overfit models (model pipelines that get cross validated).

Projects:

AppraiserServiceRegressionProject: The goal of this project was to build a model that predicted a fair transaction price of a property before it's sold. This ultimately became a regression problem. 

EmployeeRetentionClassificationProject: The goal of this was to build a model that predicted whether a full time employee at a company will quit the company any time soon. This became a binary classification problem. 

Implementation details are in the folders. :)
