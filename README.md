# MachineLearningProjects

A repository of complete end-to-end machine learning projects that I have done. Each folder is designed to have friendly code, if you are interested in the specifics of my workflow. The modules in each project are arranged sequentially, so just start from "Module 1." :)

What is interesting about these projects is that I implemented a systematic way of approaching most machine learning problems. I organize the project into modules that consist of data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training/building. Developing this system was a huge learning experience for me because before I was taught that you need to focus on knowing the math/specifics of each prediciton model (e.g. if you don't know the math behind neural networks you're an idiot!). However, after completing these projects, I realized that doing whatever possible to have good data, and developing a framework for not overfitting models (model pipelines that get cross validated) is more important. 

Projects:

AppraiserServiceRegressionProject: The goal of this project was to build a model that predicted a fair transaction price of a property before it's sold. This ultimately became a regression problem. 

EmployeeRetentionClassificationProject: The goal of this was to build a model that predicted whether a full time employee at a company will quit the company any time soon. This became a binary classification problem. 

Implementation details are in the folders :)
